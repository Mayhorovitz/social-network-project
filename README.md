# Social Network Simulation

## Overview
This project is a simulation of a social network, enabling users to interact with each other and with fan pages. The system allows members to add friends, post statuses, and interact with fan pages using **C++** with principles of **object-oriented programming (OOP)**, including inheritance and polymorphism.

## Features

### Core Functionality:
- Add members and fan pages.
- Post statuses (text, text with images, or text with videos).
- Display statuses and the most recent statuses of friends.
- Manage friendships and connections to fan pages.

### Object-Oriented Principles:
- **Inheritance**: Different types of statuses inherit from a base class.
- **Polymorphism**: Display methods adjust based on the status type.

### Advanced Features:
- Operator overloading for comparing and managing entities.
- Use of the **STL** library for efficient data structures.
